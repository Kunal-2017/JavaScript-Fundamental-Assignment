Que 2. Explain the key differences between JavaScript and HTML. Provide examples of situations where
you would use each.

Sol: Nature Of HTML & JS:

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): HTML is a markup language used for creating the structure and content of web pages. It defines the elements and layout of a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links.

JavaScript: JavaScript is a programming language used for adding interactivity, dynamic behavior, and functionality to web pages. It enables actions like user input validation, animations, and data manipulation.

Purpose Of HTML & JS:

HTML: HTML provides the basic structure and content of a webpage. It's used to organize and present information to users in a structured format.

JavaScript: JavaScript enhances the functionality of a webpage by enabling interactive elements, responding to user actions, and manipulating content dynamically.
Usage:

HTML: You use HTML to define the static content and structure of a webpage. For example, you use HTML to create headings, paragraphs, lists, images, tables, and links. Here's an example of HTML code to create a simple webpage structure:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Webpage</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Webpage</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
    <img src="image.jpg" alt="An image">
    <a href="https://www.example.com">Click here</a> to visit Example.com.
</body>
</html>

JavaScript: You use JavaScript to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to a webpage. For example, you can use JavaScript to create pop-up messages, validate form input, handle events like button clicks or mouse movements, and update content without reloading the page. Here's an example of JavaScript code to display a pop-up message:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>JavaScript Example</title>
    <script>
        function showMessage() {
            alert('Hello, world!');
        }
    </script>
</head>
<body>
    <button onclick="showMessage()">Click me</button>
</body>
</html>

Execution Of HTML & JS:

HTML: HTML is parsed and rendered by the web browser to display the content and structure of a webpage.
JavaScript: JavaScript code is executed by the web browser, either as the page loads or in response to user actions, such as clicking a button or submitting a form.
