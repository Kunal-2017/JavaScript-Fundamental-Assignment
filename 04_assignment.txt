Que.4: What is the purpose of declaring variables in JavaScript, and how do you declare them using the 'let' keyword?

Sol:
The purpose of declaring variables in JavaScript is to reserve memory space to store data that can be referenced and manipulated throughout a program. 

We declare(create) JavaScript variable with the "let" keyword.
For Ex: 
let x;
here x is a variable name. If we want to intialise variable x with some value then we can do that during declaration time.
We can store any data type value in x.
Ex:
let x = 10; //Number Data type
let x = "Hi"; //String Data type
let x = true; //Boolean Data type
let x = undefined; //Undefined Data type
let x = []; //Array Data type
let x = {};  //Object Data type
let x = null;  //Null Data type
